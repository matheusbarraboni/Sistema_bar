# SistemaBar
 This is my first "elaborated" project to try my skills in programming.
 
 This sistem was designed thinking on a automated restaurant (or any food establishment) cashier.
 
 Sistem's objective:
 - The sistem has as objective make the cashier management from restaurants easier by automating it.
 - With it will be possible check product's prices and manage them on a virtual menu, manage tables (open, add/remove consumed products), price to be paid by the client, and it will even create earning reports.
